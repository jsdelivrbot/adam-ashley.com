A simple website made with Node.js. It has a simple implementation of the Stipe API to facillitate credit card transactions at a jack&jill/stag&doe event which is accessed via a separate static access code set in the environment file. The website is mostly an informational website geared towards giving invited guests a little more information about the wedding while also allowing them to RSVP.
